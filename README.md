# Head-Phone-Zone
we learn about the fundamentals of Javascript and introduction to Data Structure and Algorithms, In the second unit, we learn about the HTML, CSS, and Advanced concepts of Javascript like HOF, DOM, etc. By using these concepts we have built our project website. Our project is to clone the Head-Phone-Zone website,At the start of our project all team members are new to each other and also each one belongs from a different region of India, so this is a great opportunity for all of us to improve our teamwork skills by interacting with each other and also develop an understanding for different cultures and practices.
